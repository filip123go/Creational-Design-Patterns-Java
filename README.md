Singleton design pattern
  - Returns same instance
  - One constructor method - no args
  - Typically No Interface
  
Builder design pattern
  - Handles complex constructors
  - No interface required
  - Can be a separate class
  - Works with legacy code
  
Prototype design pattern
  - Lighter weight construction
  - Copy Constructor or Clone
  - Shallow or Deep
  - Copy of itself 
  
Factory design pattern
  - Returns various instances
  - Multiple constructors
  - Interface driven
  - Subclasses
  - Adaptable to environment more easily
