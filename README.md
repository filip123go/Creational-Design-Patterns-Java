# Creational-Design-Patterns-Java

This is a reference project to Creational Design Patterns.  The patterns will be added gradually.


Patterns added :

Singleton design pattern
  - Returns same instance
  - One constructor method - no args
  - Typically No Interface
  
Builder design pattern
  - Handles complex constructors
  - No interface required
  - Can be a separate class
  - Works with legacy code
